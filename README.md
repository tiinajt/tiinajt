Cytometry In R

Location: Baltimore, Maryland, USA (remote)

My Favorite Fluorophore/Metal-Isotope: Don't know yet! 

Previous Coding Experience: Few years coding, but mainly using python and never handled flow data. 

What I Hope to Get From This Course: I have just generated flow cytometry data and would like to learn to analyze it also using R. In addition, 
I would like to learn to make publication quality plots.
